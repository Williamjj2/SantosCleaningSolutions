<h2 id="plans-scheduling">Cleaning Plans and Scheduling</h2>
<p>Choose a weekly, bi‑weekly or monthly plan to keep everyday areas consistently clean. We set a reliable arrival window, send reminders, and adapt to your priorities—kitchen focus one visit, bathrooms the next, or a whole‑home refresh before guests arrive. First visits typically take longer while we establish a strong baseline; subsequent visits are faster while maintaining the same high standard.</p>

    <p class="muted word-boost">Scheduling is flexible and tailored to your routine. We plan realistic windows, respect materials and finishes, and adapt priorities each visit so your home always feels guest‑ready.</p>
    <p class="muted word-boost-2">In Smyrna we regularly work around Smyrna Market Village, Belmont, Heritage and King Springs. Typical first visits include extra detail in kitchens and baths—stovetop degrease, fixtures polished, glass and mirrors bright, and edges/baseboards addressed where reachable. We protect stone, wood and modern finishes and adjust our products on request. After that baseline, a weekly or bi‑weekly plan keeps everyday areas effortless so the home is always guest‑ready.</p><p class="muted word-boost-3">Scheduling is straightforward: we agree on a window, send reminders, and share quick updates if timing shifts.

  <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:12px 0 6px">Smyrna House Cleaning Guide</h2>
  <p>Smyrna’s pace is fast—between evenings at Market Village, weekend get‑togethers and weekday commutes, the home needs a plan that is reliable and easy to maintain. Our approach is simple: we start by understanding your routine, floor plan and priorities, then choose the right service level and cadence. Most families begin with a Deep Cleaning to reset kitchens, bathrooms and high‑touch areas. After that baseline, weekly or bi‑weekly maintenance keeps everything feeling just‑cleaned with far less effort from you.</p>
  <p>What’s included depends on the visit. Recurring service focuses on everyday shine: tidy/straighten, dust exposed surfaces, wipe switches and handles, clean mirrors, and vacuum/mop floors. Kitchens include counters, backsplash, cabinet touch points, exterior of appliances, stovetop degrease and a polished sink/fixtures. Bathrooms include showers/tubs detailed, grout touch‑ups, polished glass and mirrors, shined fixtures, a thorough toilet clean—including base and behind—wiped counters and sanitized floors. A Deep Cleaning adds baseboards, reachable sills and vents, corner and edge detailing, and heavier build‑up removal where needed.</p>
  <p>Scheduling is designed around predictability. We provide a dependable arrival window, send reminders and share quick updates if timing shifts. Access instructions—gate or lock codes, parking, pets—are saved to your profile so each visit runs smoothly. If you prefer eco‑friendly or fragrance‑free products, let us know; we’ll note it and bring the right supplies. Have a room that occasionally needs extra attention before guests arrive? Tell us in advance and we’ll sequence the checklist so the result matches the moment.</p>
  <p>Move‑in/Move‑out cleaning helps during transitions in Smyrna’s busy rental and real‑estate cycles. The service can include cabinet and drawer interiors (empty) and appliance interiors on request. We recommend clearing surfaces and removing personal items before the team arrives so cleaning time is spent on the details that matter. After service, do a quick walkthrough with your priorities in mind; if something was missed, contact us within 24 hours and we’ll schedule a focused reclean of the area.</p>
  <p>Long‑term clients appreciate how the plan adapts as seasons change—pollen in spring, holiday hosting, or back‑to‑school routines. Your checklist evolves with you: sometimes the kitchen deserves the spotlight, other times bathrooms or entryways need the most care. Our goal is the same throughout: a calm, healthy home that looks great and feels easy to live in, supported by clear communication, dependable windows and careful work on every visit.</p>
