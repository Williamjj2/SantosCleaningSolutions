<p>Choose a weekly, bi‑weekly or monthly plan to keep everyday areas consistently clean. We set a reliable arrival window, send reminders, and adapt to your priorities—kitchen focus one visit, bathrooms the next, or a whole‑home refresh before guests arrive. First visits typically take longer while we establish a strong baseline; subsequent visits are faster while maintaining the same high standard.</p>
