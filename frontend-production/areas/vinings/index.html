  <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:12px 0 6px">Vinings House Cleaning Guide</h2>
  <p>Vinings combines charm and convenience—afternoons around Vinings Jubilee, trails along the Chattahoochee and quick access to Paces Ferry. Homes here often feature natural materials and open layouts, which benefit from mindful methods and a steady cleaning rhythm. We typically begin with a Deep Cleaning to lift build‑up and detail edges, then move to a weekly or bi‑weekly cadence that protects surfaces while keeping the home guest‑ready.</p>
  <p>On recurring visits we prioritize the places you use daily. Countertops and backsplash are cleaned, cabinet touch points wiped, exterior of appliances and stovetop refreshed, and sink/fixtures polished. In bathrooms we detail showers and tubs, touch up grout, polish mirrors, shine fixtures, and thoroughly clean toilets—including the base and behind—before finishing counters and floors. Living areas and bedrooms are tidied, dusted on exposed surfaces and completed with a careful floor reset so the whole space feels calm and polished.</p>
  <p>Natural stone, sealed wood and premium fixtures receive extra care. We choose products that respect materials and avoid residue, and we’re happy to use client‑preferred products when requested. Access and parking are coordinated in advance, and we provide reminders and a reliable arrival window. If pets are at home, we note door/gate preferences and work calmly so everyone is comfortable. Need interior windows (reachable) or appliance interiors? Add them to the visit and we’ll plan the time.</p>
  <p>For move‑in/move‑out cleans in Vinings, cabinet/drawer interiors (empty) and appliance interiors can be included on request, along with detailed baseboards and high‑touch points throughout the home. We encourage clients to declutter surfaces ahead of time to maximize results. After each appointment, we welcome feedback—if an area needs a second pass, reach out within 24 hours and we’ll arrange a focused reclean.</p>
  <p>Over months and seasons, your checklist adapts to real life: hosting, travel, pollen, school schedules and the little moments in between. With clear estimates, dependable windows and careful work on stone, wood and modern finishes, your Vinings home stays consistently clean without the stress. The goal is simple—precision where it counts, a fresh and healthy space every week, and more time for what you enjoy.</p>
