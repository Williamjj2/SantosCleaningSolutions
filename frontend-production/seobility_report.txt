Problematic pages or page titles that require optimization
Optimization Tips
                            Video tutorial included ▶️

                            This analysis will show you if there are problems with the page titles on your website.

                            Why page titles are important for SEO:

                             The title of a web page (also known as the "meta title" or "title tag") is one of the most important
                             elements for on-page search engine optimisation. Search engines such as Google analyse the title to
understand the content of a page and use the information it contains for ranking purposes. In addition, the title is displayed as the
most prominent element in search results and should encourage searchers to click on the "search snippet". If the title tag is
missing on a page, or if the title does not meet Google's requirements, Google may generate its own title for the search results,
which may lead to less ideal results.

What the notes in the "Problems" column mean:

      Empty: The title tag for this page contains no content.
      Missing: No title tag was found for this page.
      Too short: The page title is very short, wasting valuable optimization potential.
      Only one word: The page title consists of only 1 word, wasting valuable optimization potential.
      Too long: The page title is very long and is likely to be truncated in the search results.
      Meaningless word: The title gives no information about the content of the page.
      Domain within the title: The title contains only the domain name and gives no information about the content of the page.
      Word repetition: The title contains repeated words and could be interpreted as keyword stuffing.

How to optimize your page titles:

      Length of 55 to 65 characters.
      Important keywords for the page should be used in the title.
      2 to 3 keywords should be used in a logical context.

Problems with meta descriptions
Missing or bad meta descriptions.
Optimization Tips
                                Video tutorial included ▶️

                                This analysis shows you pages with meta description problems.

                                Why meta descriptions are important for SEO:

                           Although a page's meta description doesn't directly affect the ranking of the page, it's an important
                           element for SEO because it's displayed in the search results snippet in the SERPs. It should
encourage searchers to click on your snippet as it is the first contact they have with your website. For this reason, you should write
an engaging meta description for each relevant page of your site.

If there's no meta description, or if Google thinks your description is not relevant enough, Google will usually display a text snippet
from the page that contains the terms that a user was searching for.

What the notes in the "Problems" column mean:

      Missing: No meta description was found on the page.
      Empty: The meta description tag for this page contains no content.
      Too short: The page's meta description is very short and leaves room for optimization.
      Only one word: The meta description consists of only one word and leaves room for optimization.
      Multiple: Multiple meta descriptions were found on the page.
      Too long: The meta description is very long and is likely to be truncated in the search results.

How to optimize your meta descriptions:

      Keep to a maximum length of around 1000 pixels (Tip: You can easily optimize the length of your meta descriptions with the
      SERP Snippet Generator from Seobility).
      Provide a description of the page content that is as precise and understandable as possible and that encourages users to
      take action ("buy", "inform", "compare", "download", etc.).
      Avoid very general descriptions that reveal little about the content of the page.
      Use keywords that are relevant to the page. These will appear in bold in the snippet for relevant searches, highlighting the
      relevance of your results.
      Avoid keyword stuffing.
      Create a unique meta description for each relevant page.

Problems with headings
Pages with problematic headings or problems within the heading structure
Optimization Tips
                            Video tutorial included ▶️

                            This analysis provides an overview of pages where Seobility detected problems with headings.

                            Why headings are important for SEO:

                          Headings are used to structure the body text on a website, making it easier for visitors to navigate. In
                          addition, headings provide an overview of the page content and are also used by search engines
when analyzing the page content.

Generally, there is a hierarchical structure of headings from H1 to H6, which can be compared to the hierarchy of headings in a
regular text document. You should follow this hierarchy as far as possible to make your pages clearer for both search engines and
visitors.

What the notes in the "Problems" column mean:

      Empty heading: The page contains empty heading tags.
      Structural problem: There is an error in the heading hierarchy, such as gaps in the hierarchy (e.g. H1 > H2 > H4) or errors
      in the order (e.g. H1 > H3 > H2).
      Duplicate heading: The page contains multiple headings with the same content.
      Missing: No headings were found on the page. You should add headings to structure the content.
      Too many headings: The page contains many heading tags. Check that their number is appropriate to the amount of text.

Click "Details" for more information about which specific headings on a page are affected by a problem.

How to use headings correctly:

      Headings should always be informative and reflect the content of the following section of text. Ideally, they should also
      contain important keywords.
      The number of headings should be reasonable in relation to the amount of text.
      To structure a paragraph more granularly, always use the next lower hierarchy level without jumps (after H1 comes H2, etc.).
      Headings should be neither too short nor too long.
      Use headings only to structure content and not for navigation elements, links or surrounding layout (e.g. contact forms,
      widgets, etc.). When in doubt, ask yourself if the heading you are using is related to the content of the page. If not, do not
      format it as a heading.

Problems with strong and bold tags
Check of strong and bold tags finding too short, too long and duplicate tags.
Optimization Tips
                            Video tutorial included ▶️

                            This analysis provides an overview of pages where problems with strong and bold tags were detected.

                            What are strong and bold tags and what are they used for?

                            The tags <strong> and <b> are used to highlight important words or statements in a text. Both tags
                            cause the text they contain to be displayed in bold. Unlike the bold tag, the strong tag also marks up
the text as "semantically important".

The tags are a good way of making users aware of important elements and text sections on a page. From an SEO perspective,
however, they do not offer much room for optimization. You just want to avoid using them too much, as this could give the
impression to search engines that the page is over-optimized and unnatural.

What the notes in the "Problems" column mean:

      Many tags: A large number of strong or bold tags have been found on the page. Check that their number is appropriate to
      the amount of text.
      Empty tags: Empty strong or bold tags were found on the page. You should remove these from the HTML code.
      Too long: The text marked up with bold or strong tags is longer than 70 characters. Check if you can reduce the length.
      Duplicate: The same words are marked up with bold or strong several times.

The video tutorial above will show you how to find the problematic tags on your site.

How to use strong and bold tags correctly:

      Use the strong tag instead of bold to emphasize important text. Unlike bold, the strong tag is not just a layout element.
      Ideally, you should only use these tags to emphasise small chunks of text of up to 70 characters (rather than long strings of
      text).
      The number of visual highlights should be appropriate to the total amount of text.

Issues with file sources
Used files that have problems
Optimization Tips
                            Video tutorial included ▶️

                            This analysis will show you if there are problems with embedded files on your website.

                            Why you should avoid problems with files on your website:

                            Files that are needed to render a page should be optimized in the same way as the HTML page itself.

Problems with files can result in the page not rendering correctly. This can have a negative impact on the user experience. It can
also negatively affect page speed, which is an important Google ranking factor.

Overview of what the error messages ("Problem" column) mean and how to fix them:

      Missing content-type specification: Your server is not providing content-type information when transferring the file, which
      can lead to rendering problems in the browser. Make sure that there is a content-type specified in the HTTP header for each
      file.
      Different file extension: The file extension does not match the content-type that is specified. Make sure that the two
      specifications are in line in order to avoid any display problems. For example, a CSS file with content-type "text/css" should
      end with ".css".
      Missing compression: Files are not sent compressed from the server, which can make loading slow. Use compression, like
      gzip for text files.
      High load time: The file takes longer than 1 second to load. Check out our blog to find out how to improve your loading
      speed.
      Redirect: The source URL of the linked file redirects to a different URL. Avoid unnecessary redirects by linking all files
      directly to the target file.
      Large file size: The file size is very large. Make sure that your images are no larger than 2 MB and that your CSS and
      JavaScript files are no larger than 0.5 MB.

Medium response time
Pages that have a medium response time
Optimization Tips
The URLs in this list had an average server response time (between 0.5 and 1 second) when your website was crawled by
Seobility.

Why you should ensure a fast response time:

A server's response time contributes to the overall load time (also called "page speed") of a website which is an officially confirmed
Google ranking factor. The faster a page can be loaded, the faster and more efficiently Googlebot can crawl the page. In addition,
fast-loading pages provide a good user experience, whereas slow pages tend to frustrate users.

Note: This analysis only measures the time it takes for the server to respond to the client's request and start transmitting the
HTML page. However, the total load time of a web page will include additional steps (e.g. loading of CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
and will therefore be longer. You can use Google's PageSpeed Insights if you want to measure the total load time of a page.

The server location used to measure response time is Germany.

Pages with only a few internal links
Pages with a below-average number of internal links
Optimization Tips
The pages in this list contain very few internal links. This analysis is based on the average number of internal links on your pages
and is intended to show you pages that deviate significantly from the average.

Why internal links are important for SEO:

Internal links are very important for SEO because they allow search engines and users to navigate from page to page on your
website. Good internal linking is therefore essential for improving usability and getting your content indexed. Internal linking also
helps search engines to identify which of your sub-pages are the most important.

Ideally, each page should contain links to the main areas of the site (usually in the form of a navigation) and related pages (e.g. in
the form of "related articles"). In addition, relevant subpages can be linked directly within the text of a page, giving readers direct
access to further content on specific topics. Such links also increase the relevance of the linked page.

How to fix these problems:

Take a close look at the pages below and check why there are so few internal links on these pages. In most cases, these pages
lack navigation, which can have a negative impact on usability.

However, it may also be the case that there is a page navigation, but no other content that could link to other pages (e.g. empty
product lists, etc.). Depending on the case, you can handle such pages in the following ways:

      Add (further) relevant content, including internal links.
      Remove links pointing to these pages to prevent search engines and users from being sent to pages with no content.
      Use your robots.txt file to exclude pages from being crawled if they are not relevant to search engines.

Redirects
Internal redirects that have been linked
Optimization Tips
                             Video tutorial included ▶️

                             This list includes internally linked URLs that redirect to another URL on your website via a server-side
                             redirect (status code 301).

                             Why you should avoid having internal links to redirecting URLs:

                              301 redirects are a good option if you need to change the URL of a page, or if you want to redirect
multiple URLs to a single URL. However, for internal links, it is best not to link to a URL that redirects to another URL. Instead you
should link directly to the destination of the redirect. This will avoid any errors if you decide to remove the redirect at some point.

Search engines like Google do follow your redirects (even if you have multiple redirects in a row), but if you use a lot of redirects,
you are unnecessarily wasting the crawling resources of the search engine bots. This keeps the bots busy following your redirects
rather than crawling your actual page content. It can also increase page load time as each redirect requires a new request to be
sent to the website server.

You can find more information about redirects in our wiki and on the Google Search Central page.

What the information in this list means:

The left column ("Start URL of the redirect") shows the redirecting URL and (below it) the destination URL. The "Pages that link to
a redirect" column lists all the pages that have a link pointing to the redirecting URL. If the link is located in a canonical tag,
alternate link or similar, you will see a note saying "Linked via canonical link, alternate link or similar".

How to fix internal redirects:

Change the links on the linking pages to point directly to the redirect's destination URL.

By clicking on the redirecting URL, you can see more details about where these links are located.

Redirect loops
Redirect loops because of HTTP redirects and canonical links
Optimization Tips
                              Video tutorial included ▶️

                              The URLs listed here are part of a redirect loop.

                              What redirect loops are and why they are a problem:

                              Redirect loops occur when a URL redirects to itself or to a previous redirect.

For example: Page A redirects to page B. However, page B redirects back to page A.

This can happen due to wrongly configured redirects (301/302 redirects). Another reason could be pages that have another URL
set as their canonical URL but the canonical URL redirects back to the other page (either via a server redirect or via a canonical
link).

Redirect loops should be avoided at all costs. In theory, they redirect search engine crawlers endlessly, so that they never reach
the destination of the redirect. In reality, crawlers will stop following the redirects once they realize that there's a loop. As a result,
the content of URLs in this loop won't be crawled and indexed. In addition to that, endless loops due to redirects also cause site
visitors to receive an error message in their browser.

How to fix redirect loops:

Click on the URLs in this list to go to the "Page details" and check the redirect destination. You can click on the URL displayed
there and check its redirect destination too. Repeat this step until you have a complete overview of the redirect loop. The "Links"
tab of the "Page details" can also be helpful for this.

Then break the loop. For example, remove a page's redirect to itself, or fix incorrect canonical links. Also, make sure that you don't
have any internal links to redirecting URLs, but link directly to the destination of the redirect.

Pages with only a few paragraphs
Pages with little text or few paragraphs
Optimization Tips
The pages in this list contain less than three paragraphs of text.

Why you should break up your content into clear paragraphs:

To make text easier to read and understand, it is very helpful to break it up into paragraphs. This makes it easier for visitors to
understand your content. It also increases the likelihood that they will spend more time on your pages.

What does Seobility define as a "text block"?

A "text block" is a coherent text section that contains at least 100 characters and is enclosed by HTML structural elements such as
<p> or <div>. Headings or lists are not counted as text blocks.

How to solve these problems:

In addition to the number of paragraphs that were found, the "Number of words" column will show you how long the content of the
page is in total. If the word count is high, you should structure the text in a better way. Use headings, teasers, paragraphs and
subheadings to break up the text.

On the other hand, if there is little text content on the page, there may be room to expand the content.

Note: For pages with image galleries, result lists, and similar content that does not require long/structured text, you can ignore the
warnings.

Pages with little text
Pages that contain only very little text
Optimization Tips
The pages in this list contain less than 500 words.

Why pages with little text can be problematic:

A text that is too short is problematic if the subject or the keyword of the page requires detailed and extensive information. If your
competitors are offering better and more comprehensive content on the same topic, you're going to struggle to rank with short
content.

However, it is not necessarily a problem to have pages with little text. If the pages are e.g. image galleries, landing pages, etc., it is
perfectly fine to use very little text.

In addition, there are times when search engine users are in need of a quick and concise answer to a particular search query, and
a long and lengthy text page is not the answer. In this case, long and detailed text may deter visitors.

How you should treat these pages:

Before you make any changes to the content of a page, you should first check whether the topic or target keyword of the page
requires extensive content or not. You can do this by analyzing the current top 10 search results. With the free TF*IDF tool
provided by Seobility, you can easily check the number of words on these pages.

If you find that the content of your page is in fact too short, you can try to expand it. Think about what kind of information your
target audience needs in order to fulfil their search intent. However, you'll want to avoid writing long texts that are just designed to
boost SEO. Most importantly, your content should add value to your visitors.

Pages using keywords in page title but not in its body text
Pages with keywords in the title tag, which don't appear in the page’s body text
Optimization Tips
This list includes pages where keywords from the page title do not appear in the actual content of the page.

Why titles and content should be consistent:

The page title is one of the most important on-page SEO elements and should be a concise summary of the content of the page.
Important keywords for the page should be included in the title, with the most important keyword at the very beginning. To ensure
consistency between title and content, these keywords should also be included in the content of the page.

What the information in this list means:

The URLs affected by this problem are shown in the left column. The right column displays each URL's page title. The words in the
title that do not appear in the content of the page are highlighted in bold.

How to fix these problems:

For each page listed, check that the page title matches the actual content of the page, and vice versa.

If the title contains the most important keywords, then you should also include these keywords in the text of the page. If, on the
other hand, the text is properly optimized and the title is not, then you should optimize the title and include important keywords for
the page there.

One important note:

This analysis does not consider synonyms or declination of keywords. This means that not all of the pages that are listed here
need to be problematic. For example, if you have made grammatical adjustments to a keyword in the text of the page to ensure a
natural reading flow, then of course there is no need to make any changes. Search engines such as Google have become very
good at recognizing such variations of keywords.

Pages with keywords in the H1 tag, which don't appear in the page’s body text
Optimization Tips
This list includes pages where keywords from the H1 heading do not appear in the text content of the page.

Why H1 headings and content should be consistent:

The H1 heading is an important on-page SEO element and should be a concise summary of the content of the page. Important
keywords for the page should be included in this heading. To ensure consistency between the H1 heading and the content, these
keywords should also be included in the content of the page.

The URLs affected by this problem are shown in the left column. The right column displays each URL's H1 heading. The words in
the heading that do not appear in the text content of the page are highlighted in bold.

How to fix these problems:

For each page listed, check that the H1 heading matches the text content of the page, and vice versa.

If the H1 contains the most important keywords, then you should also include these keywords in the text of the page. If, on the
other hand, the text is properly optimized and the H1 is not, then you should optimize the H1 and include important keywords for
the page there.

Ensure that the H1 heading differs from the page title. Both elements should be unique.

One important note:

This analysis does not consider synonyms or declination of keywords. This means that not all of the pages that are listed here
need to be problematic. For example, if you have made grammatical adjustments to a keyword in the text of the page to ensure a
natural reading flow, then of course there is no need to make any changes. Search engines such as Google have become very
good at recognizing such variations of keywords.

Content that appears on several pages
Content/text that is used on more than one page
Optimization Tips
Here you will find an overview of text blocks that are used on several pages of your website.

For this analysis, each text block found on your website is normalized and saved. If the same text block appears on several pages,
it is detected and displayed here.

Notes, disclaimers, etc. that appear on a large number of your pages will not be taken into account.

Why you should avoid using duplicate text blocks:

Each page should be unique and tailored to its target keyword. This will ensure that the content is as relevant as possible. That's
why you should avoid using duplicate text blocks or generic content.

If very long text blocks are used multiple times on your website, you may also run into problems withduplicate content. For
example, if you use long snippets of blog posts on the category pages or the home page of your blog, this could have a negative
effect on the rankings of the actual blog posts. This is because Google has to decide which of these pages should appear in the
search results if both a category page and a blog post contain relevant content for a keyword. As a consequence, it may choose
the wrong one.

How to fix these problems:

As a general rule, you should avoid using generic text that is used on multiple pages. Create unique content for each subpage
instead.

To avoid duplicate content problems, keep the preview text of blog articles or similar as short as possible.

Duplicate Content
Pages whose complete content appears on other pages
Optimization Tips
Here you will find a list of pages whose content was also found on other pages of your website (=duplicate content).

Why you should avoid duplicate content:

Duplicate content is very problematic from an SEO perspective and should be avoided at all costs. If you have a number of pages
with the same content, search engines such as Google have to decide which of these URLs is the most relevant for the keyword in
question and should be displayed in the search results. As a result, it may happen that the "wrong" URL is selected. In addition,
duplicate URLs can spread positive ranking signals such as backlinks across the different URLs. This can cause the individual
pages to rank lower than if these signals were consolidated on one URL.

This analysis checks for the following types of duplicate content:

This duplicate content check refers to duplicate content within your website, i.e. it does not analyze whether the content is used on
any other website in the world wide web.

The following types of duplicate content can be detected:

      Page duplicates: The content of one page is identical to the content of another page. In these cases, the URLs are labelled
      "duplicate". This does not require a 100% match of the pages, but only of their body text. There may be differences in other
      elements such as the page title.
      Included pages: The content of page A is fully contained within the content of page B, but page B also contains additional
      content. This is indicated by the label "Included" next to the URL of the included page.

How to fix these problems:

Duplicate content is usually a technical problem or a problem with your content management. It is unlikely that you have
deliberately written the same text twice.

In order to fix the problem, you will first need to find out what is causing the duplicate URLs. The most common causes of
duplicate pages are:

      Your pages can be accessed both with and without the "www." in the URL. From a technical point of view, this creates
      duplicate content, as the same content can be found under two URLs. You can solve this problem by setting up a site-wide
      301 redirect to the preferred URL variant. You can find more information on how to do this in our wiki.
      URL parameters, e.g. for sorting products on shop category pages. These change the order of the products displayed.
      However, the content of the pages remains the same. You can solve this problem by adding a canonical tag to the URL
      variants with parameters. This tag should link to the "original" variant without parameters.
      Categories or tags are not distinctive enough and return the same results. In order to avoid this, you should only use tags
      and categories that are clearly differentiated in terms of content and that have as little overlap as possible.

Common causes of included pages:

      Blogs display the full article content on category pages or the homepage. In this case, you should only use a very short
      snippet of the text content as the preview text.

Other causes of duplicate content, solutions, and ways to avoid can be foundin this blog post.
