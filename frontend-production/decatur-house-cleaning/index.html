        <p>From historic homes in Oakhurst to modern apartments in Downtown Decatur, our house cleaning service delivers
            consistent results with a professional checklist.

            Kitchens are degreased and wiped end‑to‑end, bathrooms are sanitized and polished, and living spaces are
            dusted high and low before floors are vacuumed and mopped.

            We use surface‑appropriate products for stone and hardwood and include HEPA filtration vacuums on every
            visit.</p>
        <p>First‑time deep cleans add time for baseboards, blinds, vents and fixtures as well as optional inside oven
            and fridge.

            Move‑in/move‑out service includes cabinet interiors and detail work so listings show at their best.

            If you prefer a recurring plan, we keep a consistent team when possible and note any preferences including
            fragrances, pet considerations and building access instructions.</p>

            email.
