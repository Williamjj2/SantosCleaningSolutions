Pages with only a few internal links
Pages with a below-average number of internal links
Optimization Tips
The pages in this list contain very few internal links. This analysis is based on the average number of internal links on your pages
and is intended to show you pages that deviate significantly from the average.

Why internal links are important for SEO:

Internal links are very important for SEO because they allow search engines and users to navigate from page to page on your
website. Good internal linking is therefore essential for improving usability and getting your content indexed. Internal linking also
helps search engines to identify which of your sub-pages are the most important.

Ideally, each page should contain links to the main areas of the site (usually in the form of a navigation) and related pages (e.g. in
the form of "related articles"). In addition, relevant subpages can be linked directly within the text of a page, giving readers direct
access to further content on specific topics. Such links also increase the relevance of the linked page.

How to fix these problems:

Take a close look at the pages below and check why there are so few internal links on these pages. In most cases, these pages
lack navigation, which can have a negative impact on usability.

However, it may also be the case that there is a page navigation, but no other content that could link to other pages (e.g. empty
product lists, etc.). Depending on the case, you can handle such pages in the following ways:

      Add (further) relevant content, including internal links.
      Remove links pointing to these pages to prevent search engines and users from being sent to pages with no content.
      Use your robots.txt file to exclude pages from being crawled if they are not relevant to search engines.

You can find a detailed guide on how to optimize the internal linking of your websitehere.

Redirects
Internal redirects that have been linked
Optimization Tips
                             Video tutorial included ▶️

                             This list includes internally linked URLs that redirect to another URL on your website via a server-side
                             redirect (status code 301).

                             Why you should avoid having internal links to redirecting URLs:

                              301 redirects are a good option if you need to change the URL of a page, or if you want to redirect
multiple URLs to a single URL. However, for internal links, it is best not to link to a URL that redirects to another URL. Instead you
should link directly to the destination of the redirect. This will avoid any errors if you decide to remove the redirect at some point.

Search engines like Google do follow your redirects (even if you have multiple redirects in a row), but if you use a lot of redirects,
you are unnecessarily wasting the crawling resources of the search engine bots. This keeps the bots busy following your redirects
rather than crawling your actual page content. It can also increase page load time as each redirect requires a new request to be
sent to the website server.

You can find more information about redirects in our wiki and on the Google Search Central page.

What the information in this list means:

The left column ("Start URL of the redirect") shows the redirecting URL and (below it) the destination URL. The "Pages that link to
a redirect" column lists all the pages that have a link pointing to the redirecting URL. If the link is located in a canonical tag,
alternate link or similar, you will see a note saying "Linked via canonical link, alternate link or similar".

How to fix internal redirects:

Change the links on the linking pages to point directly to the redirect's destination URL.

By clicking on the redirecting URL, you can see more details about where these links are located.

Redirect loops
Redirect loops because of HTTP redirects and canonical links
Optimization Tips
                              Video tutorial included ▶️

                              The URLs listed here are part of a redirect loop.

                              What redirect loops are and why they are a problem:

                              Redirect loops occur when a URL redirects to itself or to a previous redirect.

For example: Page A redirects to page B. However, page B redirects back to page A.

This can happen due to wrongly configured redirects (301/302 redirects). Another reason could be pages that have another URL
set as their canonical URL but the canonical URL redirects back to the other page (either via a server redirect or via a canonical
link).

Redirect loops should be avoided at all costs. In theory, they redirect search engine crawlers endlessly, so that they never reach
the destination of the redirect. In reality, crawlers will stop following the redirects once they realize that there's a loop. As a result,
the content of URLs in this loop won't be crawled and indexed. In addition to that, endless loops due to redirects also cause site
visitors to receive an error message in their browser.

How to fix redirect loops:

Click on the URLs in this list to go to the "Page details" and check the redirect destination. You can click on the URL displayed
there and check its redirect destination too. Repeat this step until you have a complete overview of the redirect loop. The "Links"
tab of the "Page details" can also be helpful for this.

Then break the loop. For example, remove a page's redirect to itself, or fix incorrect canonical links. Also, make sure that you don't
have any internal links to redirecting URLs, but link directly to the destination of the redirect.

Canonical link errors
Canonical links that refer to broken links
Optimization Tips
                            Video tutorial included ▶️

                            This analysis lists pages with canonical link errors.

                            Why you should avoid canonical link errors:

                            Canonical tags signal to search engines like Google that the linked URL is the "original" version of the
                            page and should be indexed. However, if this URL is inaccessible or, for example, a page has multiple
canonical tags, you make it difficult for search engines to index your content correctly. You should therefore make sure that
canonical links are always clear and that the linked pages do not have any technical problems.

What the notes in the "Problem" column mean:

      Problematic status code: The canonical link points to a URL that returns a problematic HTTP status code (e.g.404 error).
      You can find an overview of the meaning and the causes of the various HTTP status codes here.
      Broken target: The canonical link points to a "broken" or wrong target, such as an image file instead of an HTML page.
      Canonical link markup is empty: There is no URL in the canonical tag for this page.
      More than one canonical link on page: The page has more than one canonical tag, which sends conflicting signals to
      search engines.
      Canonical link target is redirect: The URL linked to in the canonical tag redirects to another URL.
      External domain: The URL in the canonical tag is located on an external domain. External canonical links should only be
      used in exceptional cases and only if there is a good reason to do this.

How to use canonical links correctly:

      Every page should have a canonical link pointing to either the original content or the page itself.
      There should be only one unique canonical link for each page.
      The URL in the canonical tag should be an accessible page that has no technical errors or redirects.

You can find more information about canonical links in our wiki.
